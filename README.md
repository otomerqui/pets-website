# Pet Website React App

## Project from Codecademy's Frontend Engineer Career Path
### By Otoniel Mercado

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Outline 

This project is a pet adoption website that allows users to view all adptable pets of a particular species, as well as view each specific pet profile. The goal of this project was to add client-side routing to this React application.

## What I Learned

<ul>
  <li>Creating routes by wrapping the application in a Router</li>
  <li>Using the useParams hook to give components access to the values of the current URL parameters</li>
  <li>Replacing the "a" HTML anchor element with React Router elements (Link & NavLink)</li>  
</ul>
